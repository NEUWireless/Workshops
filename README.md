## Linux
 Linux has been around since the mid-1990s and has since reached a user-base that spans the globe.
 Linux is everywhere: from your phone, to your theromostat, to the backbone of the internet.
Come to this workshop to learn about this important computer engineering topic!

## LaTeX
LaTeX is a typesetting system that is widely used in technical and scientific writing.
If you're interested in publishing papers, or just making your lab reports look nice, LaTeX is an invaluable tool.

## Modern C++
C++ is a very powerful language, largely in part due to its Standard Template Library (STL).
This workshop complements the C++ taught in Cornerstone or Algorithms.
Come to this workshop to learn the modern, powerful tools that C++ provides that might not have been taught in classes.
All experience levels welcome.

## Git Workshop
Git is an industry standard tool for maintaining large code bases.
Learning Git gives a large head start for the tools used in professional software development.
All experiences levels welcomed.
